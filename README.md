# Docker-Compose Tutorial 

[Here's a more detailed blog post about this]()

### Prerequisites 
You will need docker and docker-compose installed to use this. 

You can test that each are installed on your machine by running 

```
$ docker -v
$ docker-compose -v
```

If both of those return versions instead of erroring out, you're ready to go. 

### Dive in
If you want to jump right into it, follow these steps 

```
$ cd src/app/ && npm install
```

Then, navigate back to the project root, where the `docker-compose.yml` file is located, 
and run 

```
$ docker-compose up
```
